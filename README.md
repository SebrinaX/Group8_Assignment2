# Data Analytics With Python
### Assignment 2:COMP20008 Data Science Project
## <0DATA0006_2021_OCT_PAR_1> Group 8
## Student Names:
   * Maryam Shayan 
   * Priyanka Garg
   * Vinh Nguyen
   * Peiling Xian
## Objectives
The objectives of this assignment are:

* To gain experience in practical data wrangling with real-world datasets.
* To practice using a variety of data analysis algorithms and determining suitable approaches to a real-world problem.
* To build e-portfolio as a data scientist in training.
* To gain experience in written communication of analysis and results on a topic related
to data science.

## Hypothetical Scenario and Objective
It has often been observed that energy consumption tends to be at its highest on days with
hotter temperatures. As a data scientist, you have been tasked with developing models that
predicts the maximum daily energy use and pricing based on weather data. The hope is that
these models can be used to predict likely energy demands based on a weather forecast, which
can help energy companies understand plan for future usage, and help businesses plan when
to conduct energy-intensive operations.

The following two datasets are provided:
* weather data.csv contains key weather indicators, such as minimum and maximum
temperatres for the city of Melbourne for each day between January and August 2021.
This data has been extracted as-is from the Bureau of meteorology and collated into a
single file for your convenience.
* price demand data.csv contains energy price and demand figures for the state of Victoria for each half hour period between January and August 2021. This data has been
extracted from the Australian Energy Market Operator, and modified slightly for the
purposes of this assignment.


Working in a team of 3-4 students, you should build two models:
* A model which predicts the maximum daily energy usage based on the provided weather
data.
* A model which predicts the maximum daily price category based on the provided
weather data.
You will also need to evaluate the effectivness of the model.
Assessment
Your Report
Your report should be no more than 2000 words in length excluding figures and tables. Your
report should include the following information:
1. What wrangling and aggregation methods have you applied? Why have you chosen
these methods over other alternatives?
2. How have you gone about building your models and how do your models work?
3. How effective are your models? How have you evaluated this?
4. What insights can you draw from your analysis? For example, which input variables
are most valuable for predicting energy usage/price?
5. Why are your results significant and valuable?
6. What are the limitations of your results and how can the project be improved for future?
Your report should make effective use of visualisations to support your argument.
